# UnblockZone Reorganization Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Created Directory Structure**
   - `/data` - For structured data files
   - `/templates` - For HTML templates
   - `/scripts/content-management` - For content management scripts
   - `/scripts/utilities` - For utility scripts
   - `/scripts/update-scripts` - For migration and update tools

2. **Moved Files to Their New Locations**
   - Data files → `/data/`
   - Template files → `/templates/`
   - Content management scripts → `/scripts/content-management/`
   - Utility scripts → `/scripts/utilities/`
   - Update scripts → `/scripts/update-scripts/`

3. **Updated File References**
   - Updated references in template files
   - Updated references in HTML files
   - Ensured all paths point to the new file locations

4. **Verified File Accessibility**
   - Ran test script to confirm all files are accessible
   - All 17 files are properly accessible in their new locations

## Current Status

✅ **COMPLETE**: The file reorganization is successfully completed.

The website now has a more organized structure with:
- Clear separation of data, templates, and scripts
- Logical grouping of scripts by purpose
- Proper reference updates in all files
- No broken links or missing files

## Scripts Created for the Migration

1. `scripts/update-scripts/update-file-paths.js` - Updates file paths in HTML files
2. `scripts/update-scripts/update-references.js` - More robust script for updating references
3. `scripts/update-scripts/remove-old-files.js` - Safely removes old files after verifying they exist in new locations
4. `scripts/test-file-access.js` - Tests if all files are accessible in their new locations

## Documentation

A comprehensive `ORGANIZATION.md` file has been created explaining the new structure and organization, which will help future developers understand and maintain the codebase.

## Next Steps

This reorganization provides a solid foundation for further improvements:

1. Continue migrating individual game and app HTML files to use the template system
2. Update content management scripts to work with the new directory structure
3. Consolidate duplicate code across templates
4. Implement a more robust routing system

These changes have positioned the project for better scalability and maintainability going forward.
